%h1 I GOT UR PAYPAL
%h2 I just stole all of your PayPal and am currently redistributing your wealth to the political party opposite your own.
%p It's true. As soon as you entered this page, I subtly reverse-engineered things and- well, the details aren't important. Basically I've stolen all your dough, yo.
%p You know those evil villains in the movies that seem to have a billion gajillion dollars and they blow it all on laser beams carefully manufactured from a secret volcano-based moon space platform? Those risky enterprises don't run themselves. So I've taken the liberty of sending your money straight to them.
%p Luckily, the space laser platform has already been built. The high quality shark tank, however, has been funded in part due to people like you. Thanks!
%p jk. lol lol, rofl rofl, et cetera. But it <b>COULD</b> have happened, somehow. Hey, don't look at me; you were the one blindly clicking the crap out of a random link on the internet. You should be more cautious. Professor Karnage could have stolen all your hard-earned milk money.
%p Well, that's a little far-fetched. "Professor Karnage" is a little clich&eacute; as far as Evildoer Enemy Names go. Besides, if he's secured a professorship (say nothing about possible tenure), you'd think he'd opt to avoid the incorrect &mdash; albeit edgy &mdash; spelling of "Carnage".
%p== But hey, it's not all bad. <b>#{@total}</b> others have theoretically blown their eBay stash on shark tanks, too, so you're not alone. Just think, if everyone had $13.57 in their PayPal accounts, that would be worth a grand total of $#{number_with_delimiter(@total.gsub(',','').to_i * 13.57)}, which could probably secure you at least one shark.
