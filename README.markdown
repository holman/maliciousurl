# maliciousurl.com

I made maliciousurl.com in a fit of rage one day after single-handedly-- actually, wait, you should [go here](http://maliciousurl.com) first. I'll wait.

What the fuck, man. You just blindly clicked a link. You know that could have been ***DANNNNNNNGEROUS***, right? It's the internet! Could'a been anything! Consider this micro-app a PSA against that.

Anyway, I forgot I had this closed-source from like a year ago, and shit should be open, so here we go. It was a tiny superquick experiment to try out DataMapper and Haml, both of which I discovered I don't really like, so you could say this experiment failed. But hey, I wrote some funny shit, so I like that. Send me a pull request if you wrote some funny shit, too.
